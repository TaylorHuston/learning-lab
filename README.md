> **Owner:** Taylor Huston
> **Focus:** Continuous learning, architectural experiments, and technology evaluations.

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository serves as a centralized "monorepo" for my ongoing technical research. It contains prototypes, proofs of concept (PoCs), and study notes. Tutorials I have followed along with, exercises from books, one-off experiments. Moving to consolidating them all into one place, as opposed to cluttering my GitHub with dozens of short, unfinished, unpolished projects.

> **Note:** Projects herein range from "Hello World" syntax checks to complex architectural prototypes. Please check the individual README in each subdirectory for context and scope.
