# 🔬 Learning Lab

> **Owner:** Taylor Huston
> **Focus:** Continuous learning, architectural experiments, and technology evaluations.

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository serves as a centralized "monorepo" for my ongoing technical research. It contains prototypes, proofs of concept (PoCs), and study notes. Tutorials I have followed along with, exercises from books, one-off experiments. Moving to consolidating them all into one place, as opposed to cluttering my GitHub with dozens of short, unfinished, unpolished projects. Embracing "learning in public." 

> **Note:** Projects herein range from "Hello World" syntax checks to complex architectural prototypes. Please check the individual README in each subdirectory for context and scope. Projects may be "graduated" to standalone things if they're interesting enough.

## 🌟 Featured Experiments
